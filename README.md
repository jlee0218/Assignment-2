# Sixth 0110

Sixth 0110 is meant to encompass the post-human and the transhuman as a cybernetic melding of man and machine not only on a physical level, but on a psychological level. A sixth cybernetic sense that will develop as humans turn to cybernetic enhancement; as we take control of our own evolutionary development the fusion between man and machine can only stay solely physical for so long. 
Sixth is meant to explore that impossible nebulous sixth sense through a feedback of mental and physiological sensations. Subjects are presented in a blank room with only a mirror, then they are presented with a piece of cloth/mask to interact with how they please. Once placed upon their face they look into the mirror and are invited to express different emotions through facial features which will result in different patterns and fluctuations in the light and shadow. The lights and the patterns should superimpose over the reflection of the subjectâ€™s face, changing their image of themselves as they conort their faces both intentionally and unintentionally.
